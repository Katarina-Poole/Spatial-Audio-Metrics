<br>
Spatial Audio Metrics (SAM) is a toolbox in Python that allows the visualisation and comparison of HRTFs and analysis of spatial audio experiments with new features being continually added. It was made in order to provide open-source tools that allow easier analysis of data within the spatial audio domain.

# Documentation

# Installation
You can install the package using pip:
